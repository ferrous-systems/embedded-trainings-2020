# ` dongle`

Pre-made applications for the nRF52840 Dongle.

These applications will be used in the beginner workshop.

## Hardware

### LEDs

- The green LED (LD1) is connected to pin P0.6
- The red channel of the RGB LED (LD2) is connected to pin P0.8
- The green channel of the RGB LED (LD2) is connected to pin P**1**.9
- The blue channel of the RGB LED (LD2) is connected to pin P0.12

Both LEDs are mounted near the USB connector.

### Buttons

- The Reset button is mounted sideways near the edge of the board that's opposite of the USB connector.
- The SW1 button is connected to pin P**1**.06. This round-ish button is right next to the RESET button but closer to the USB connector.

## Changing the puzzle secret string

### Create the secret string

Run the `puzzlegen.rs` program on the host to create a new secret string.

``` console
$ cargo new --bin puzzlegen

$ cp puzzlegen.rs puzzlegen/src/main.rs

$ cd puzzlegen
$ # or manually modify the Cargo.toml
$ cargo add rand

$ # update the plaintext in `src/main.rs`
$ cargo run
```

Take note of the output; it will look like this:

``` text

secret: "<p=-*Uh5&Ph6=PQ_z_6=Q_-Zh_-h&IPh?cj?>>?>h$IUQhL&P*Up&6w"
```

### Generate `puzzle.hex`

``` console
$ git clone --branch dongle-puzzle https://github.com/japaric/embedded2020

$ cd embedded2020/firmware/apps
```

Copy the `puzzle.rs` from this folder into the `embedded2020/firmware/apps/src/bin` folder.

Update that copy of `puzzle.rs` with the `FROM`, `TO` and `SECRET` data that you got from `puzzlegen`

````

Build the program; this will produce an ELF file.

``` console
$ cargo build --bin puzzle --release
```

Convert that ELF file into a .hex file.

``` console
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O ihex ../target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/puzzle puzzle.hex
```

Test the produced `puzzle.hex` file:

- flash it onto a dongle using `cargo xtask dongle-flash`. The green LED on the dongle should turn on
- run `cargo xtask serial-term`; you should see the following output. `deviceid` will be different
``` text
deviceid=d90eedf1978d5fd2 channel=25 TxPower=+8dBm app=puzzle.hex
```
- run the `radio-puzzle-solution` program on a DK; it should be able to decrypt the new secret
- run `cargo xtask change-channel <some number between 11 and 26>` to test changing the Dongle's radio channel
- modify and re-run the `radio-puzzle-solution` program on a DK to solve the puzzle using a the channel you set in the previous step

### Generate `puzzle-nousb-*.hex`

The procedure is similar to the one for generating the `puzzle.hex`. The differences are:

- you copy `puzzle-nousb.rs` into the `embedded2020` repository
- you also need to change `const CHANNEL` in the `puzzle-nousb.rs` copy
- you need to produce one hex file per hard-coded radio channel.

Also test these `nousb` .hex files. Note that the green LED won't turn on when the dongle restarts! The green LED will toggle when a new packet is received and the blue LED will turn on when the decoded secret is received. Also, `cargo xtask change-channel` won't work with the `nousb` variants so you can skip that test.
