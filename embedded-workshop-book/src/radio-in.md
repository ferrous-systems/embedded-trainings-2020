# Radio In 

In this section we'll explore the `recv_timeout` method of the Radio API. As the name implies, this is used to listen for packets. The method will block the program execution until a packet is received or the specified timeout has expired. We'll continue to use the Dongle in this section; it should be running the `loopback` application; and the `serial-term` application should also be running in the background.

The `loopback` application running on the Dongle will broadcast a radio packet after receiving one over channel 20. The contents of this outgoing packet will be the contents of the received one but reversed.

Open the `src/bin/radio-recv.rs` file and click the "Run" button.

The Dongle expects the packet to contain only ASCII characters and will not respond to packets that contain non-ASCII data. If you only send packets that contain byte string literals *with no escaped characters* (e.g. `b"hello"`) then this requirement will be satisfied. At the same time the Dongle will always respond with ASCII data so calling `str::from_utf8` on the response should never fail, unless the packet contents got corrupted in the transmission but the CRC should detect this scenario.

The Dongle will respond as soon as it receives a packet. If you insert a delay between the `send` operation and the `recv` operation in the `radio-recv` program this will result in the DK not seeing the Dongle's response. So try this: add a `timer.delay(x)` call before the `recv_timeout` call; try different values of `x` and observe what happens.

Having log statements between `send` and `recv_timeout` can also cause packets to be missed so try to keep those two calls as close to each other as possible and with as little code in between as possible.

> NOTE Packet loss can always occur in wireless networks, even if the radios are close to each other. The `Radio` API we are using will not detect lost packets because it does not implement IEEE 802.15.4 Acknowledgement Requests. If you are having trouble with lost packets, consider adding a retry loop.
