# Checking the API documentation

We'll be using the `dk` Hardware Abstraction Layer. It's good to have its API documentation handy. You can generate the documentation for that crate from the command line:

✅ Run the following command from within the `advanced/firmware` folder. It will open the generated documentation in your default web browser.

``` console
$ cargo doc -p dk --open
```


> ❗️ If you are using Safari and the documentation is hard to read due to missing CSS, try opening it in a different browser.
